## üß™ Research & Projects  
‚ö° Many of my recent projects (KASAM, AI Inventory, CV Surveillance, VAANI, etc.) are defense collaborations and **cannot be shared publicly due to confidentiality agreements**.  
Instead, I share sanitized code snippets, learning repos, and open-source experiments here.  

Key areas I‚Äôve worked in:  
- **Autonomous Systems & Defense AI:** Situational awareness, UAV guidance, cyber-physical security.  
- **Generative AI & Diffusion Models:** Text-to-Sketch and Sketch-to-Image (Stable Diffusion, DRDO DYSL-AI).  
- **NLP & LLM Applications:** RAG-based teaching systems, multilingual voice assistants, GPT model integration.  
- **Cryptography Research:** Post-Quantum Cryptography (homomorphic encryption + AI cryptanalysis).  
- **Healthcare & Finance AI:** Early disease detection, AI-enabled inventory, applied finance models.
